# Investor_playground

This Android app is a playground for your investor skills!
Select a company listed in the Oslo Stock Exchange and see its price evolution over time and the annualized return rate. 
Compare with a benchmark of your choice (for example, a composite index) and see their correlation and beta (a measure of the risk).
There's also a handy compound interest calculator at the action bar.

Check it out in Google Play Store: https://goo.gl/6ADWNL
