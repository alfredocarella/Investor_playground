This Android app is a playground for your investor skills!
Select a company listed in the Oslo Stock Exchange and see the price evolution over time. 
Compare with a benchmark of your choice (for example, a composite index) and see their correlation and the beta (risk).
There's also a compound interest calculator included in the action bar.
